To get here using the tube, either exit at Heinrich-Heine-Allee or at Schadowstraße, then walk for about three minutes. If you take the bus, also exist at Heinrich-Heine-Allee. More information can be found [here](https://www.hdu.hhu.de/kontakt).

## Accommodation

All speakers need to organise their own accommodation. However, a limited number of places for couch surfing provided by local students are available for free. These places will be allocated on a first come first served basis, so please contact us ASAP if you wish to couch-surf.

Many hotels can be found in walking distance of the venue. Some are listed below:

## Getting Here

[Düsseldorf Airport (DUS)](https://www.dus.com/en) is Germany’s third largest airport. Many international airlines operate from here. If you arrive here, take the city train S11 to reach the central station in about 11 minutes.

[Cologne Bonn Airport (CGN)](https://www.cologne-bonn-airport.com/en.html) is another large airport close to Düsseldorf. If you arrive here, the easiest way to get to Düsseldorf is the regional train RE6 which takes about one hour.

There is also [Weeze Airport (NRN)](http://www.airport-weeze.com/en), a small airport located far from Düsseldorf. We recommend flying to Düsseldorf or Cologne-Bonn instead.

Düsseldorf Central Station is serviced by national and international trains. Check the website of the [Deutsche Bahn](https://www.bahn.com/en/) for connections.

## Getting Around

In general, most locations are located within walking distance. However, there are also overground and underground trains operated by [Rheinbahn](http://www.rheinbahn.com/). Multi-language ticket machines are located within the trains. Taxis are available, too.

Information for tourists are available [here](https://www.duesseldorf.de/international.html). If you have more time, you may also be interested in visiting [Cologne](https://www.cologne-tourism.com/) or the [Ruhrgebiet](https://www.metropoleruhr.de/en/start/).
