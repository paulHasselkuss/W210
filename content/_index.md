The Düsseldorf Graduate Workshop for Philosophy is a yearly event for early career researchers in metaphysics and neighbouring fields that takes place at Heinrich-Heine University Düsseldorf, Germany. It aims to provide an opportunity for PhD students and early career researchers to present and discuss their research in a safe environment and establish connections with renowned researchers.

The workshop is organized by Till Gallasch (Würzburg), Paul Hasselkuß (Düsseldorf), and Sara Ipakchi (Düsseldorf). It is generously supported by the [Faculty of Arts and Humanities](http://www.philo.hhu.de/en.html), Heinrich-Heine University, and by [Prof. Dr. Markus Schrenk](https://www.philosophie.hhu.de/en/staff/philosophy-iii-metaphysics-and-philosophy-of-language/markus-schrenk) (Düsseldorf) of the DFG Research Group [Inductive Metaphysics](https://indmet.weebly.com/) (FOR2495).
