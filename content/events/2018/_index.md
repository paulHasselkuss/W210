The first Düsseldorf Graduate Workshop for Philosophy discussed questions such as: How to choose between competing metaphysical theories? What is metaphysical realism to do about functionally equivalent theories? Are metaphysical concepts normative?

The workshop was organized by Till Gallasch, Paul Hasselkuß, Sara Ipakchi and Jessica Struchhold (Duüsseldorf). It was generously supported by the [Faculty of Arts and Humanities](http://www.philo.hhu.de/en.html), Heinrich-Heine University, the [German Society for Analytic Philosophy](https://www.gap-im-netz.de/en/), and by [Prof. Dr. Markus Schrenk](https://www.philosophie.hhu.de/en/staff/philosophy-iii-metaphysics-and-philosophy-of-language/markus-schrenk) (Düsseldorf) of the DFG Research Group [Inductive Metaphysics](https://indmet.weebly.com/) (FOR2495).
